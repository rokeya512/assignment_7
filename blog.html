        <h4>Question-1: Difference between localStorare and sessionStorage?</h4>
        <p><strong>Ans: </strong>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
            localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a
            document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to
            that particular tab.</p><br>

        <h4>Question-2: Difference between globalScope and blockScope?</h4>
        <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Global scope variables can use within the program anyware. Global variables are
            declaring outside any functions. Local scope variable value is only for that particular scope (function).
            Local variables are declaring inside that particular function.</p><br>

        <h4>Question-3: How work event loop in JS?</h4>
        <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing
            callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks
            the Task Queue for available callbacks.</p><br>

        <h4>Question-4: How much get undefined in JS?</h4>
        <p><strong>Ans: </strong>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or
            statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
            function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p><br>
